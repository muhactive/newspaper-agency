# Newspaper Agency

You are the chief in the newspaper agency.
And you are working with great team of Redactors.
But you don't track Newspapers, published by your agency,
in a proper way. For that purpose you decided to create a system
for tracking Redactors, assigned to Newspapers.
So you will always know, who were the publishers of each Newspaper.

Of course not,” Tacopina said. “How could I subscribe to that when I’ve had no interactions with the judge that would lead me to believe he’s biased?”",

Occupying some 44,000 square feet, the much-anticipated Museum of Art and Photography (MAP) is set to be India’s first major art museum dedicated to the full range of the subcontinent’s contemporary visual culture, with a promise to redefine the country’s museum landscape in the process.\r\n\r\nA main driver of MAP’s approach is its focus on reaching and connecting its local community. That desire to make art a collective conversation open to all is visible on the museum’s exterior where a spray-painted, monochrome mural by street artist Marco Santini consists of words submitted from the community: meaningful, mirror, and inspiration, for example.",

It was Alphonse Bertillon, a French police officer and researcher.\r\n\r\nPolice had already been photographing suspects from the earliest moments of photography, but the type and quality of the images varied dramatically. Bertillon theorized that standardizing the process would be a more useful tool. And, thus, the mug shot was born.\r\n\r\nHere he is demonstrating his famous format in 1912.",

      "content": "DALLAS — Let’s stipulate that it’s pretty hard to make Kim Mulkey really cry. Not phony ref-pleading bawling, but actual tears. By the time the final three-pointer had slipped silkily through the net for LSU, and her team had finished utterly wrecking Iowa with 102 points, she staggered against the scorer’s table and wept with astonishment at what they had done. LSU’s national championship was so unexpectedly brilliant that it was nearly as brilliant as that shimmering circus fire juggler’s outfit Mulkey had on, and some kind of fire was what she put in her team.\r\n\r\n“It’s really not like me,” she said. “ … I don’t know what it was, but I lost it.”\r\n\r\nLord knows what she said to them behind closed doors to provoke such a record outburst of points in that 102-85 national final. But you got some kind of clue from the way Angel Reese stalked tournament darling Caitlin Clark, Iowa’s player of the year, at the buzzer. First, Reese mockingly passed a hand over her face in that “You can’t see me gesture,” the one Clark herself had borrowed from WWE wrestler John Cena, the one that means you’re a superhero. Then Reese followed Clark toward the handshake line, holding up her ring finger and gesturing at it.",

      "content": "Gustav Klimt created the famous Beethoven Frieze for the XIVth exhibition of the Association of Visual Artists Vienna Secession, which was held between April 15 and June 27, 1902. Conceived as a tribute to the composer Ludwig van Beethoven, the presentation epitomized the Secessionists’ vision of an encompassing synthesis of the arts. Twenty-one artists worked together under the direction of Josef Hoffmann.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt the center of the exhibition, in the main hall, stood Max Klinger’s Beethoven statue. In addition to Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze, the show featured wall paintings and decorations by Alfred Roller, Adolf Böhm, Ferdinand Andri and numerous other artists. The stated objective was to reunite the separate arts—architecture, painting, sculpture and music—under a common theme: the “work of art” was to emerge from the interplay of the design of the rooms and the wall paintings and sculptures.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKlimt’s monumental wall cycle was located in the left-hand aisle, which visitors to the exhibition entered first. An opening in the wall offered a view of Max Klinger’s Beethoven statue, hinting at the intended synergy of architecture, painting (Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze) and sculpture (Klinger’s Beethoven).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith nearly 60,000 visitors, the XIVth exhibition was one of the Secession’s greatest public successes. It also proved crucial to Klimt’s further development, as well as that of numerous other participating artists: the ideal of the interplay and aesthetic integration of all artistic disciplines and the collaboration tested in the Beethoven exhibition was successfully continued by the Wiener Werkstätte, among others.",

      "content": "The Apple TV+ series Extrapolations is a difficult watch for a number of reasons. There’s the attempt to predict the end of the world in anthology format. The hurling of data at a stunned viewers face, with title sequences listing global temperature increase and population displacement. The absence of any believable or relatable characters. And the fact that it’s on Apple TV+. \r\n\r\nExtrapolations creator Scott Z Burns has respectable form in the “we’re all going to die” genre – his 2011 screenplay Contagion became panic viewing at the start of the Covid pandemic thanks to its accuracy, the result of his detailed research with the World Health Organisation. For Extrapolations he’s taken current predictions on climate change and, um, extrapolated them to imagine what the earth will be like decades into the future. Although, as far as I can tell, there are no predictions suggesting that whales will end up speaking with Meryl Streep’s voice. \r\n\r\nThe script is data led, features Streep, Sienna Miller, Forest Whitaker, Marion Cotillard, Edward Norton and a host of other big-name stars in an unimpeachably worthy work of well-meaning celebrity cringe. It has characters saying things like “25 years ago, we thought crypto was going to be our saviour. Now it’s killing us with the carbon footprint.” And after hearing about an earthquake a normal everyday commuter says with their actual mouth the following words: “Sea-level change. More water, more weight on the tectonic plates.”",
